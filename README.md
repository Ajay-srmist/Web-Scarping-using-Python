This Python project scrapes IMDb's Top 250 Movies list using the BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing and the requests library for making HTTP requests. The script extracts key data like movie rank, title, release year, and IMDb rating by navigating the pageâ€™s DOM structure. Results are displayed in a simple list format in the console.

Key features include:

HTTP requests with custom headers for browser simulation.
HTML parsing to locate and extract movie data.
Output formatted with essential movie details.
This project uses Python 3, BeautifulSoup, and requests.
